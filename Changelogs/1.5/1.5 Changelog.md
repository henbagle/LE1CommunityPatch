#### **LE1 CP 1.5 Changelog**

**Changelog:**

Updated the Mod Settings menu framework to take advantage of the LE1 Coalesced merge feature available in ME3Tweaks Mod Manager v8.1. This mod requires the updated version of the mod manager

Integrated the Persistent Options mod for LE1. This will add an FOV option to the settings menu of the game
