# LE1 Community Patch Issue Tracker
This repository serves as a record of what has been and what will be changed by Community Patch mod for Mass Effect 1: Legendary Edition.

View all bugs fixed by the LE1 Community Patch project on the issues tab. If you encounter a bug not on the issue tracker, feel free to open a new issue with detailed, reproduceable steps to trigger the bug, and a fix will be investigated and added to the mod if possible.

All fixes are open to discussion and debate. If you feel a fix should or should not be included in the patch, please make your case. Toxic and derogatory comments will be deleted. This repository serves as a record of what has been changes by the mod.

This mod is currently being managed by HenBagle and the Mass Effect Modding Workshop.

## Community Involvement
This is an open modding project. Anyone can contribute fixes, and all can use this mod for any purpose without permission from it's authors. The community should be able to clearly see what is being changed in this mod, as well as how and why. Fixes should be open to debate.

If you would like to contribute a bugfix, please reach out to HenBagle. 

The goal of this mod is to provide bugfixes, as well as to provide a baseline for other mods. In an ideal world, future mods for LE1 should be able to build off of this mods files, so that bugfixes are maintained for users of this mod, and so users who do not use this mod can reap the benefits. As such, we should not include anything in this mod that is controversial, or unwanted by a majority of the userbase. 

This mod will not include cut content, new content, QoL features, or artistic changes to the original game.

## Mod Priorities
**1. Bugfixes**

The primary goal of this project is to fix all possible bugs in Mass Effect 1: Legendary Edition

**2. Minor Lore Corrections**

Minor lore inconsistencies within LE1 and between LE1 and the other Mass Effect games may be fixed in this mod, where it is exceedingly clear that the inconsistency was a mistake or minor oversight by BioWare. These fixes should be thoroughly discussed before implemented, so it can be clear that they should be fixed and are not intended by BioWare.

**3. Modding QoL**

Where possible, we would like to make the quality of life better for the modders who work on LE1. These back-end improvements should have zero impact on gameplay or performance. These improvements should be throughly debated and tested. This is last on the priority list for a reason. To bring this project in line with the planned community patch for LE3, these changes would be included in a seperate mod package, so that one could install purely bugfixes with no streaming changes if desired.
