Instructions:
Thank you so much for agreeing to translate for the LE1 Community Patch! Here are some instructions, though it's pretty self-explanatory.
Below are a series of numbers and english phrases from the game. Please translate each line of text onto the line below. 
Some lines already have translations, these are from the game. They will probably need updating to match the english text (which has been changed from the vanilla game)
If lines should differ between a male or female shepard, please put them both down and specify which is which. Please leave the english text and numbers where they are so we know which line goes where.
Please include your username at the top so we can credit you
Thank you!!!
